# Antinomy - A Digital Adaptation

This project is a digital adaptation of the card game [Antinomy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/251441/antinomy), which was designed by John Baluci 
 and published by [Button Shy Games](https://buttonshygames.com) in 2019.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
